        <p><em>Senior Product Manager at <strong><a href="https://www.hotstar.com">Hotstar</a></strong> || Techno-commercial professional and Keen learner</em></p>
        <p>I am an aspiring web and app developer and I love coffee.</p>
        <p>As Product Manager professional - I am excited about technology and the power of internet. I started my career as a software development professional - a side of me still loves to create. I am also a keen learner and often get disappointed
          by
          not being able to learn fast enough. My aspirations to know more ofter surpasses my abilty to do so. If I were to dream of a superpower it would be the power to learn faster than the speed of light</p>
